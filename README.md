# Web-Project
The project is about ATTENDANCE MANAGER WEBSITE
This website takes attendance record of students and displays appropriate attendance percentage
It also displays the lecture when the student was absent
All the teacher needs to do is to login and fill the details of class i.e(YEAR, DIVISION) note currently the database contains data of only 3rd year computer engg students and its teacher's
And then a appropriate sheet is generated which has the student's rollno as a button (green indicates present and red indicates absent) by default all the buttons on the sheet are green
The teacher presses the button of the roll no of the student marked as absent (which changes from green to red)
The database included contains the appropriate data required for attendance management 
The student rollno are like 60004140001-60004140060 in year 3rd and division A department COMPUTER ENGINEERING
You can add it according to your requirements 
The website has a login page 
so to login as student you can use id as rollno and the same rollno as password
and to login as teacher you can use 60001001-60001005 as id and 60001001-60001005 as password
loging as a teacher will give you right to change the attendance sheets and add a new sheet
note the sheet added with the database will be added with a timestamp so that the student can view the time when he missed the lecture
This is all if you need something feel free to contact me
